# Release Team Charter

# Mission

The release team manages the releases of the Rust project. This primarily consists of the following activities:

* Regression triage (shared with T-compiler)
* Release notes drafting
* Release blog posts
* Releasing itself (i.e. buttons, timing, process)
* Whether to issue a stable point release?
* Beta backport management (the act itself, not approval)

Periodically, the release team discusses and consults others on the following things:

* Target policies, such as deprecation and stabilization for tier-1 targets
* Toolchain distribution (e.g., rustup <> dist builds interaction)

## How does this further the Rust Project goals?

## What work is not specifically part of maintainership?

These activities may be carried out by contributors or maintainers, but are not considered core activities that ‘count’ towards [maintainership](https://github.com/rust-lang/governance/blob/master/common/membership_types.md#maintainership)

* Attending weekly meetings
* Release notes drafting
* Beta backport rollups

## Team Membership

Team members are expected to:

* Manage Rust releases
* Attend weekly meetings
* Manage Crater kickoff and triage
* Track and perform check-ins for regressions
* Draft release blog posts
* Follow the [common member requirements](https://github.com/rust-lang/governance/blob/master/common/member_requirements.md)

Team members can take a break from these expectations as outlined in the [Vacation Policy](https://github.com/rust-lang/governance/blob/master/common/vacation_policy.md)
